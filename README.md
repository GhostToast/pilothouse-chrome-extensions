2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

3. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to pop up a file-selection dialog.

4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

You should now see the Pilothouse App XDebug extension in your browser.

### Using
Click the icon to activate the XDebug cookie. This will vary based on the tab your are currently viewing. A gray icon indicates XDebug is currently inactive and yellow means it's activated.
